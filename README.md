### Overview:
This program intakes a .txt file with data for number of gears, specific gear ratios, differential ratios <sup>1</sup> and tire diameter to create an output (in revolutions per minute) of the engine speeed of the car with the specified specifications. Simplified, this is a digital tachometer.

<sup>1</sup> Unfortunatley there are some cars that have variable differential ratios like the Ford Focus RS, currently the program is not set up to deal with more than 1 differential ratio. This may cahange in the future.

### When in the simulation:
<div style="background-color; border: 1.5px solid #ddd; padding: 10px;">
Use the keys 'a' to accelerate the car and 'd' to decelerate the car. <br>
Use the keys 'UP' to shift to a higher number gear and 'DOWN' to shift to a lower number gear.</div>

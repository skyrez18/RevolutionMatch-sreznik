This program intakes a .txt file with data for number of gears, specific gear ratios, differential ratios <sup>1</sup> and tire diameter to create an output (in revolutions per minute) of the engine speeed of the car with the specified specifications. Simplified, this is a digital tachometer.

<sup>1</sup> Unfortunatley there are some cars that have variable differential ratios like the Ford Focus RS, currently the program is not set up to deal with more than 1 differential ratio. This may cahange in the future.
